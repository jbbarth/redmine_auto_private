Redmine Auto Private plugin
===========================

This plugin forces private issues for the projects you want. It is useful for projects with
multiple users who shouldn't be able to see each other's issues. In such a context, users
may not understand the implications of checking "Private" on their issues, or they could
just forget it, which leads to unecessary information leaks accross the project. This plugin
acts as a safety net for those issues by automatically setting every issue "Private" flag
to "true" on Issue creation and update.
